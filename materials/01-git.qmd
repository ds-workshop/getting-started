## The Problem

::: {.incremental}

Consider the following situations:

- We've been working on a project for ages. We have a core, legacy script that has gone through about 30 different iterations with edits from dozens of people as the project has changed over the years. We need to audit how that script has changed over time.

- We made a change to one of the core functions of our project and everything seemed to be great. But two weeks later we discovered a change to a helper function broke something in our monthly report. We're now trying to figure out what we changed and how to patch it.

- Someone recently mentioned that lightgbm + linear trees offers a really nice improvement in both training time and performance over XGBoost. They want to test it in our project, and then evaluate whether this should become the new model. 

:::

## Version Control

For each one of these scenarios, we intuitively wanted something resembling version control. We want to tinker with making a change, but we don't want that change to overwrite or break our existing code. 

. . .

People implement their own approaches to version control all the time.

. . .

[We make a copy of the original, then create a new copy that we begin to edit and work on without breaking the original source.]{.fragment .highlight-red}

. . .

We've all probably come up with some version of crazy, half-baked version syntax to control the various versions of projects/files. 

. . . 

## So why Git?

. . .

If you're like me, at some point you thought to yourself, maybe I could be that guy who uses Git and talks about **commits** and **pull requests** and really knows what he's doing with dev vs prod environments rather than just putting **\_dev** and **\_test** at the end of important files.

. . . 

I'm going to *improve*.

. . .

I'm going to be more than I've ever been.

. . .

I'm going to use Git.

![](images/this_is_the_bad_place.gif){fig-align="center"}



## The Reality

And about thirty minutes later it was so unclear how any of this would help you that you just punted and decided to keep working as you always have, warts and all, because Git clearly comes from **The Bad Place**.

## The Reality

So many of the frustrations with writing code, making changes, and storing the history of your work go away once we implement version control.

. . .

There's a reason Git is used everywhere. It is the life jacket in a sea of stashing files everywhere with poor naming conventions and no lineage or history.

. . .


You have to learn how to use Git.

. . .


It's going to be painful.


. . .



[But it's worth it.]{style="font-size: 80px;"}


## Why should we *commit* to this?

. . .

From [Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control by Jennifer Bryan:](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928)

. . .

> Why would a statistician use a version control system, such as Git? And what is the point of hosting your work online, e.g., on GitHub? Could the gains possibly justify the inevitable pain?
**I say yes, with the zeal of the converted.**

. . .

> Doing your work becomes tightly integrated with organizing, recording, and disseminating it. It’s not a separate, burdensome task you are tempted to neglect.

. . .

> Collaboration is much more structured, with powerful tools for asynchronous work and managing versions.

. . .

> By using common mechanics across work modes (research, teaching, analysis), you achieve basic competence quickly and avoid the demoralizing forget-relearn cycle.

## 

Despite this zeal, she does make an important note:

. . .

> Now the bad news: Git was built neither for the exact usage described here, nor for broad usability. You will undoubtedly notice this, so it’s best to know in advance.

. . .

Git was not designed for data science projects. This will at times create slightly wonky implementations and workarounds that feel frustrating. 

. . .

Things get more complicated once we start trying to version control data/models, which is a whole topic in and of itself.


# With and Without Git: <br> An Example {

background-size="contain"

## Was Luke Really That Whiny?

. . .

Suppose we have a project we are working on. We are interested in running text/sentiment analysis on the scripts of the original Star Wars trilogy. 

. . .

We want to know things such as, who are the most positive/negative characters in A New Hope? A lot of people have claimed Luke was really whiny; is that the case?

. . .

##

So, naturally, we go and get the script from A New Hope in text form. 

. . .

```{r load and look at star wars text}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: starwars-dialogue

clean_starwars = function(data) {
  
  data |>
    mutate(episode = case_when(document == 'a new hope' ~ 'iv',
                               document == 'the empire strikes back' ~ 'v',
                               document == 'return of the jedi' ~ 'vi')) |>
    mutate(character = case_when(character == 'BERU' ~ 'AUNT BERU',
                                 character == 'LURE' ~ 'LUKE',
                                 TRUE ~ character)) |>
    select(episode, everything())
}

# load starwars
starwars = read_csv(here::here('materials', 'data', 'starwars_text.csv'))  |>
  clean_starwars()

# show first few lines of a new hope
starwars |>
  head(10) |>
  select(episode, document, character, dialogue) |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt::as_raw_html()

```

##

We tokenize the data, remove stopwords, and then calculate sentiment in a pretty simple way.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: starwars-text

data("stop_words")

starwars_tokenized =
  starwars |>
  unnest_tokens(word, dialogue) |>
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

starwars_tokenized |>
  inner_join(tidytext::get_sentiments("afinn"), by = "word") |>
  head(10) |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt::as_raw_html()
 
```

## 

We then calculate sentiment across all characters to get a sense of how negative Luke really was.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-dpi: 300

starwars_tokenized |>
  filter(document == 'a new hope') |>
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"), by = "word") |>
  group_by(document, character) %>%
  summarize(sentiment = sum(value), .groups = 'drop') |>
  ggplot(aes(y=reorder(character, sentiment), x=sentiment, fill = sentiment))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_gradient2_tableau(limits=c(-5, 2), oob = scales::squish)+
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = "sentiment",
                                title.position = "top",
                                barwidth=8,
                                barheight=0.5))+
  ylab("character")+
  xlab("sentiment score")+
  facet_wrap(document~.)

```

##

Apparently, pretty negative. Let's look at some dialogue.

```{r}
starwars_tokenized |>
  filter(document == 'a new hope') |>
  filter(character == 'LUKE') |>
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"), by = "word") |>
  group_by(document, character, line_number) |>
  summarize(value = sum(value),
            .groups = 'drop') |>
  left_join(
    starwars,
    by = join_by(document, character, line_number)
  ) |>
  arrange(value) |>
  head(20) |>
  select(document, character, line_number, value, dialogue) |>
  group_by(document) |>
  gt::gt()
```


##

This is interesting enough, so we save the script, that produces this analysis, called **sentiment.R**.

. . .

Then we think, maybe we should see what happens if we calculate sentiment in a different way. Were Han and Ben really that negative? Even simple methods of sentiment can vary quite a bit depending on which lexicon you use, so we should try a couple.

. . .

##

But we might want to stick our first approach, so we decide to write a whole new section to our code, or just add a new script entirely, **sentiment_bing.R**.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-dpi: 300

starwars_tokenized |>
  filter(document == 'a new hope') |>
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") |>
  count(document, character, line_number, index = line_number %/% 8, sentiment) |>
  arrange(index) |>
  group_by(document, character, sentiment) |>
  summarize(value = sum(n),
            .groups = 'drop') |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = c("sentiment"),
              values_from = c("value"),
              values_fill = 0) |>
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative) |>
  ggplot(aes(y=reorder(character, sentiment), x=sentiment, fill = sentiment))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_gradient2_tableau(limits=c(-5, 2), oob = scales::squish)+
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = "sentiment",
                                title.position = "top",
                                barwidth=8,
                                barheight=0.5))+
  ylab("character")+
  xlab("sentiment score")+
  facet_wrap(document~.)

```

## 

We get a pretty similar result, so we're feeling okay about ourselves and less okay about Luke.

. . .

But then someone says, we shouldn't rely on such crude methods for calculating sentiment. We should use a more sophisticated method, via the *sentimentr* package.

. . .

So we want to edit our original **sentiment.R** script and switch over to using this new package. This one forces us to add some new packages, and rewrite some of our visualization scripts to get the same type of visualization, so we create a new script, **sentiment_algorithm.R**.

##

We're also slightly worried that we've forgotten what we originally started with, so we're gonna make a **sentiment_original.R** file. Just so we have it.

. . .

But anyway, we'll edit our code for the third time and run it again.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-dpi: 300

starwars_sentimentr = 
  starwars |>
  get_sentences() |> 
  sentiment_by(by = c('document', 'character', 'line_number')) |>
  sentimentr::uncombine()

starwars_sentimentr_summarized = 
  starwars_sentimentr |>
  group_by(document, character) |>
  summarize(
    word_count = sum(word_count, na.rm = T),
    sum_sentiment = sum(sentiment, na.rm = T),
    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment, na.rm = T),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

starwars_sentimentr_summarized |>
  filter(document == 'a new hope') |>
  slice_max(word_count, n = 40) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x=sum_sentiment,
      y=reorder(character, sum_sentiment),
      fill = sum_sentiment
    )
  )+
  geom_col()+
  scale_fill_gradient2_tableau(limits=c(-5, 2), oob = scales::squish)+
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = "sentiment",
                                title.position = "top",
                                barwidth=8,
                                barheight=0.5))+
  ylab("character")+
  xlab("sentiment score")+
  facet_wrap(document~.)

```


##

This gives us very different results, so we really need to dive into the data bit here to figure out what's going on.

. . .

We decide to compare how our original method (left) calculates sentiment for the entire script of A New Hope compared to **sentimentr** (right). That means we need to go add a visualization to each of our original scripts, so we go edit **sentiment_original.R** and **sentiment_algorithm.R**.

## 

These are very different, so now we go down a rabbit hole of digging into what we're getting out of the **sentimentr** package. We take a look at Luke's dialogue line by line.

##

We realize that we shouldn't be calculating sentiment at the line-level and then aggregating, because short positive statements potentially end up getting as much weight as longer complaints.

With this method we really should look at the estimated sentiment across a character's entire dialogue to get a sense of their tone.

##

So we implement a change, shifting away from aggregation by summing to using the average sentiment over all lines. We then calculate the estimated sentiment across all characters.

. . .

What we are left with after a fairly simple analyses is a messy, entangled set of files with absolutely no sense of history or organization.

##

This is a mess for us to figure out, imagine if someone else is supposed to come along and work with this code. Where do they start?

## 

How would this look if we were using Git?

The end result is a bit cleaner. We basically just have the one script to worry about. If we're really curious about what we need to do, we check the README (yes, you are expected to read these).

![](images/starwars_folder.png){fig-align="center"}

##

The end result of our work is the **current state** of the project, which we store in a **repository**.

![](images/starwars_repo.png){fig-align="center"}

##

If we want to see the work that we did up to this point, all we have to do is look at the history of that script and the various changes, or **commits**, we made to it.

![](images/starwars_commits.png){fig-align="center"}

## 

This allows us to easily view how our script changed as we worked on it.

## Why Go Through This Exercise

Because I wanted to make Star Wars jokes.

## Why Go Through This Exercise

In short, git is tremendously helpful even just for one individual.

. . .

It removes the mental baggage of worrying about editing your code and remembering what you did. It allows you to make changes, track the history of your project, and document everything you did along the way.

. . .

Where it starts to get even more helpful is for enabling collaboration within a team.

# With and Without Git: Predictive Modeling

## Git for Data Science

Suppose we were working on a predictive modeling project instead of looking at Star Wars scripts.

Think about the pieces involved in a typical predictive modeling project. 

. . .

- Loading data
- Cleaning data
- Splitting data
- Feature engineering
- Model specification
- Tuning parameters
- Model evaluation
- Model selection
- Model deployment

## Git for Data Science

We typically don't build all of this at once and have everything finalized from the get go.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  raw[Raw Data] --> clean[Clean Data]
  clean --> train[Training Set]
  clean --> valid[Validation Set]
  train --> preprocessor(Preprocessor)
  preprocessor --> resamples[Resamples]
  resamples --> model(Model Spec)
  model --> features(Features)
  features --> tuning(Tuning)
  tuning --> valid
  preprocessor --> valid
  valid --> evaluation[Model Evaluation]
  train --> final(Model)
  valid --> final
```

##

We build incrementally, typically testing and experimenting with different pieces along the way.

Maybe we start out by just estimating a simple baseline model.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  raw[Raw Data] --> clean[Clean Data]
  clean --> train[Training Set]
  clean --> valid[Validation Set]
  train --> model(Baseline Model)
```

## 

Then maybe we decide to add in some feature engineering and tune a ridge regression over 25 bootstraps, which requires normalization and imputation.

```{mermaid}

flowchart LR
  raw[Raw Data] --> clean[Clean Data]
  clean --> train[Training Set]
  clean --> valid[Validation Set]
  train --> preprocessor(Preprocessor)
  preprocessor --> resamples[Bootstraps]
  resamples --> model(glmnet)
  model --> features(Impute + Normalize)
  features --> tuning(Tuning)
  tuning --> valid
  preprocessor --> valid
  valid --> evaluation[Model Evaluation]
  train --> final(Model)
  valid --> final

```

Then maybe we decide to try out a more flexible model like lightgbm with minimal feature engineering.

```{mermaid}

flowchart LR
  raw[Raw Data] --> clean[Clean Data]
  clean --> train[Training Set]
  clean --> valid[Validation Set]
  train --> preprocessor(Preprocessor)
  preprocessor --> resamples[Cross validation]
  resamples --> model(lightgbm)
  model --> features(Minimal)
  features --> tuning(Tuning)
  tuning --> valid
  preprocessor --> valid
  valid --> evaluation[Model Evaluation]
  train --> final(Model)
  valid --> final

```

## Git for Data Science

In each of these cases, we have **code** that we have executed and **results** associated with that code. 

. . .

Just as with the Star Wars example, we could try to store a bunch of scripts and track all of the results in different folders. 

. . .

Or, we could use Git to track our code and the results of our experiments.

> As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of **creative destruction and fiery controversy**.

. . .

> The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. During the early years of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary [Distributed Version Control System] called BitKeeper.

. . .

> In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.

## Git

Git is a **version control system**. 

. . .

Git was originally developed for the purpose of helping (Linux) developers work in parallel on their software projects.

. . .

Git manages and tracks a set of files - referred to as a **repository** - in a highly structured way.

. . .

Though originally intended for software development, Git is now used by data scientists in a variety of different ways to track the odds and ends that go into data science projects.

## GitHub

GitHub is a hosting service that stores your Git-based projects in a **remote location**.

. . .

Storing your code on GitHub allows you to share/sync your work with others (as well as have a safe back up for when you inevitably mess up your local repository).

. . .

We'll focus on GitHub (because it's what I use, but there are other options out there as well). GitHub has additional features for managing projects and automating aspects of a project, we'll touch on tht later.

# Creating a New Repo

## Creating a New Repo

Git is highly structured way of managing a set of files, called a repository. In order to see this in action, we need to start with a set of files.

. . .

We have a new project that we'll call **git-started**.

. . .

We want to create a new GitHub repository,  **github.com/phenrickson/git-started.git**

. . .

We want to create a new RStudio project, **git-started.Rproj**

. . .

We want to connect RStudio to GitHub so our project is synced with our repository.

. . .

We can do this in a couple of different ways, starting in either GitHub or RStudio. 

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. **Click on New repository.**

## {background-image="images/github_new_repo.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. Click on New repository.
4. **Name the repository**
5. **Initialize the repository with a README**

## {background-image="images/github_create_project.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. Click on New repository.
4. Name the repository
5. Initialize the repository with a README
6. Click Create repository.

## {background-image="images/github_git_started.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. Click on New repository.
4. Name the repository
5. Initialize the repository with a README
6. Click Create repository.

This creates a new repository on GitHub, but **we still need to connect it to RStudio**. To do this, we need to clone this repo from RStudio.

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. Click on New repository.
4. Name the repository
5. Initialize the repository with a README
6. Click Create repository.
7. **Open a New Project in RStudio**
8. **Create from Version Control**

## {background-image="images/rstudio_version_control.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. Click on New repository.
4. Name the repository
5. Initialize the repository with a README
6. Click Create repository.
7. Open a New Project on RStudio
8. Create from Version Control
9. **Paste in your Repository URL from GitHub**

## {background-image="images/rstudio_clone_repo_link.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## {background-image="images/github_clone_repo.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## GitHub -> RStudio

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in with your account
2. Click on Repositories.
3. Click on New repository.
4. Name the repository
5. Initialize the repository with a README
6. Click Create repository.
7. Open a New Project on RStudio
8. Create from Version Control
9. Set Repository URL to link of GitHub repo
10. **Set name and location of project**
11. Create project

## GitHub -> RStudio

These steps inside of RStudio can also be taken care of by using the **usethis** package, but I tend to just go through the process each time.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

usethis::create_from_github("https://github.com/phenrickson/git-started.git")

```

## GitHub -> RStudio

These steps inside of RStudio can also be taken care of by using the **usethis** package, but I tend to just go through the process each time.

Under the hood, this last bit is essentially just:

> git clone "https://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO.git"

# `r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", "white")` Your Turn {background-color="#447099" transition="slide-in"}

- Create a new Git repository on GitHub, **git-started**
- Add a description to the project (whatever you would like)
- Initialize this repository with a README
- Create a new RStudio project
- Connect this RStudio project to your GitHub repo

```{R}
#| echo: false
countdown_timer(5)
```

## GitHub -> RStudio

Creating a new project with GitHub first then cloning with RStudio is what I would tend to recommend.

. . .

It's the same process as cloning repositories from other people, plus it takes care of some pieces behind the scenes. 

. . .

You can however also start by first creating an RStudio project, then initialize a GitHub repository second. This process can be useful to know if you want to set up a GitHub repo for an existing project.


## RStudio -> Github

1. Create a new RStudio project.
2. Check 'Create a git repository'

## {background-image="images/rstudio_create_project.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## RStudio -> Github

1. Create a new RStudio project
2. Check 'Create a git repository'
3. **usethisthis::use_git()** to add and commit your initial files 
4. **usethis::use_github()** to create a repository on GitHub and connect your R project

## {background-image="images/rstudio_git_started.png" background-position="center" background-color="white" background-size="contain"}

## RStudio -> Github

Under the hood, this is essentially just:

> git init
> git add .
> git commit -m "Initial commit"
> git remote add origin 'https://github.com/phenrickson/git-started.git'
> git push -u origin maain

- Local: “on your personal machine”
- Remote: “on the official server”
- Branch: A version of the directory
- Commit: A change made to a version of the directory
- Push: Uploads your work to the ‘official’ remote server
- Fetch/Pull: Checks for available updates on a remote
- Switch/Checkout: Switches your local copy to a version of the directory
- Pull Request: A request to merge one branch into another
